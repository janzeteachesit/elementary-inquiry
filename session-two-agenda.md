### Notes
- On the whole we talked about how much of what was asked for in the new curriculum is already being done by teachers in other Language Arts/Science/Social Studies projects, and how to “wrap-in” new curriculum activities.  Oh, and the focus of ALL activities was Real-World; i.e. No computer required; great as a supplement, but not necessary.
- We spent the most time looking at the Project-Mapping-to-ADST-6-9 – what the sections mean and how they compare to the STEM Design model.  
- We also looked at the “Choose Your Own Adventure” project (pp 53 – 71) in the Unit-1_Unit-2 pdf.  A number of groups looked at how they might implement a Choose Your Own Adventure as a (Non-)Fiction, branching story. 
- Finally, we spent a bit of time with the Discover_Skills_BC pdf as it is an interesting Design Project looking at a real-world need: providing footwear to people who can’t afford to buy any.
- I also talked a bit about the new Communicating Student Learning District Inquiry group that I was a part of this year, and what the District direction was on what to do about the Core Competencies.  I also offered to share the documents what we had developed to help meet that need, as well as the documents I was developing around the Content and Curricular Competencies for Grade 6 & 7 Math, Science and ADST.
