# What Is "Tinkercad"?

### [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) is a simple, online 3D design and 3D printing app for everyone.
Tinkercad is used to make toys, prototypes, home decor, Minecraft models, jewelry and many more things.
### How it works:

#### 1. Place
Shapes are basic building blocks of Tinkercad. A shape can add or remove material. Import your own, or work with existing shapes.
#### 2. Adjust
Move, rotate and adjust shapes freely in space. Use tools like the ruler to input exact dimensions.
#### 3. Combine
Group together a set of shapes to create models as detailed as you want.

  1. Teachers: sign in to your account to create an Invite Code from the Teach page and share it with your students. Many teachers write the code on the board.
  2. Students log in and access their dashboard by clicking the Tinkercad logo.
  3. Students enter the Invite Code in the Get Approved box. They are added to teacher’s Moderated Kids as approved Tinkercad users. Students age 13+ may create their own Tinkercad account and start designing immediately. Students age 12 and under will need the Invite Code for instant approval of their accounts.
