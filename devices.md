#### Content Learning Standard
> Students will experience a minimum of three modules of Applied Design, Skills, and Technologies 6-7 in each of Grades 6 and 7. Schools may choose from among the modules listed below or develop new modules that use the Curricular Competencies of Applied Design, Skills, and Technologies 6-7 with locally developed content. Locally developed modules can be offered in addition to, or instead of, the modules in the provincial curriculum.

- https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/adst/6 & https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/adst/7
   - simple algorithms (for sorting, searching, sequence, selection, and repetition; specific statements to complete a simple task; cryptography and code breaking (e.g., cyphers)) that reflect computational thinking
   - visual representations (graphs, charts, network diagrams, info graphics, flow charts, lists, tables, or arrays) of problems and data
   - evolution of programming languages (historical perspectives, evolution (e.g., Ada Lovelace, punch cards, Hollerith, Grace Hopper, Alan Turing, Enigma, cyphers))
   - visual programming (for example, Kodu, Scratch)

- https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/adst/8
   - software programs as specific and sequential instructions with algorithms that can be reliably repeated by others
   - debugging algorithms and programs by breaking problems down into a series of sub-problems
   - binary number system (1s and 0s) to represent data
   - programming languages, including visual programming (for example, Scratch, Alice, Greenfoot, BlueJ) in relation to text-based programming (for example, HTML) and programming modular components (for example, Arduino, LEGO Mindstorms)
